# Hijazi Font
A digital model for the historical Arabic Hijazi Script

The importance of the Hijazi script is based on the fact that the earliest mushafs (the Qur'an codices) were written with this script. In this project we will try to model the script using a Truetype/Opentype font that will enable users to model the script and include it in application documents such as  word processing, design, or web documents.

The approach is to use current standard font technologies that are independent of platform, thus enabling the wide usage of the product.
